  <h1>Website Design Elements I Like</h1>

  <h2>Colour</h2>
  <p>I'm a big fan of colour in design, and interesting colour combinations and clashes. My CSS skills are very fresh currently, so I hope in time I can more effectively manipulate colour. Effects like gradients can be very visually interesting, but also minimalistic icons that have disctinct colour can allow web elements to pop out and have their own unique space.</p>
