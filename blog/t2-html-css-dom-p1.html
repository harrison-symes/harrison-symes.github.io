    <h1>Website Design Elements I Like</h1>

    <h2>Colour</h2>
    <p>I'm a big fan of colour in design, and interesting colour combinations and clashes. My CSS skills are very fresh currently, so I hope in time I can more effectively manipulate colour. Effects like gradients can be very visually interesting, but also minimalistic icons that have disctinct colour can allow web elements to pop out and have their own unique space.</p>

    <h2>Minimalistic</h2>
    <p>I like the idea of using simple but bold fonts and font size, often overlaying and contrasting colour or an image. To make the text contrast with an image I like either a black and white image, or a landscape image out of focus to create a parralax illusion.

    <h2>Animated</h2>
    <p>I assume that animations of web elements will be covered when we begin learning Javascript, as that can manipulate the HTML. I would like to learn many of these elements, as some of the Zen Garden websites demonstrated interesting elements that can't really be shown with screenshots. But simple touches like having text fade in as you scroll down the page can draw the eye to the information in a smooth yet striking way. Also the animation of image/text boxes can make them feel more physical. Having a box grow and shrink upon mouseover, or have elements translate their locations on screen can make for an exciting and natural web experience.</p>

   <p>Using an analogy from the udacity lesson 1 videos, the website is like a house. Html describes the rooms of the house and what they "contain". CSS describes the "Furniture" and stylings of each room, and the whole house in general. DOM (document object model)describes the tree like structure that the website is based on. Each element and section of the the website is a brach of a tree in the DOM. Each node of the tree is an object, representing a part of the overall document/website. for example, the head of the website is broken down into its comprised elements and they each branch off until the section is fully described. Its likes breaking the look of a website into boxes, except doing it with the code instead of the visuals. 
   <p>carrying on from there, boxifying design is when you break down the interface and space of a website into all of the "box elements" it is comprised of. Every elements of a website; text boxes, images, title cards, etc, is actually a rectangular space. So boxifying a webpage involves boxing out the rectangular sections of the elements. Sometimes the boxes are nested, and this is important to how you allocate the space with css, as some rectangular sections are alligned or related, or contained within a larger rectangular space.</p>
   <p>The box model breaks down each rectangular section into it's parts. Each part of the box model is like a frame around the other part. At the very center is the "content", so the text or image that holds the rectangular space. the frame around the content is the "padding", whichs clears a transparent space around the content. This just pushes other elements a set distance away from the contents space. The next frame is the "border". And it is just that, a border, that wraps around the padding and content. And finally there is the margin. similar to the padding, the margin just creates a transparent space around the border</p>
