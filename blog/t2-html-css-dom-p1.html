  <h1>Website Design Elements I Like</h1>

  <h2>Colour</h2>
  <p>I'm a big fan of colour in design, and interesting colour combinations and clashes. My CSS skills are very fresh currently, so I hope in time I can more effectively manipulate colour. Effects like gradients can be very visually interesting, but also minimalistic icons that have disctinct colour can allow web elements to pop out and have their own unique space.</p>

  <h2>Minimalistic</h2>
  <p>I like the idea of using simple but bold fonts and font size, often overlaying and contrasting colour or an image. To make the text contrast with an image I like either a black and white image, or a landscape image out of focus to create a parralax illusion.
  </p>

  <h2>Animated</h2>
  <p>I assume that animations of web elements will be covered when we begin learning Javascript, as that can manipulate the HTML. I would like to learn many of these elements, as some of the Zen Garden websites demonstrated interesting elements that can't really be shown with screenshots. But simple touches like having text fade in as you scroll down the page can draw the eye to the information in a smooth yet striking way. Also the animation of image/text boxes can make them feel more physical. Having a box grow and shrink upon mouseover, or have elements translate their locations on screen can make for an exciting and natural web experience.</p>
