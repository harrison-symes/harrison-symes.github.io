<h2>What did I learn?</h2>
<p>While it is hard to pinpoint exactly what I learnt, there are certain points that resonated with me. The first speaker in the 101 video talked about how his "job title" stemmed from his general merriness, and his passion for making other people laugh. In the workplace I am the same, I take on a character who aims to entertaining my colleauges and work friends. I understand that work can be repertitive and tiresome, and so in the hospitality industry, sometimes a good laugh now and then can help seperate the monotony of quiet hours, and the stress or a rush hour. I can assume the same goes for the web development industry. Sometimes the work load can feel heavy, but while you are surrounded by people who are sociable and entertaining to you, the stress can be negated. 
Emotional Intelligence helps people to maintain a positive attitude in the workplace, both with their own work, and how they work and interact with others. Stopping to be mindful of the work other people are doing and the expectations of yourself both as a worker and a peer can help you to act rationally with awareness. This is a positive skill in the work industry, as irrational, erratic and inconsiderate workers and undesireable, no matter how skilled they are, when it comes to working in a team. </p>

<p>Before starting at dev I have had a growing interest in the mind. When it comes to concepts such as ego and awareness, so the concepts of mindfulness fall under this interest to me. The mind can operate in automatic or manual mode, and one of the best examples of this to me is breathing. When you think about your breathing, you are manually breathing. Eventually you will forget about your breathing and you will start breathing automatically. The same can go for concentration, as stated in this chapter. When you lose concentration, you can gain it again as soon as you realise that you lost it. So similar to breathing, there is analogously manual and automatic concentration. The expectation of training yourself to concentrate, it that if you keep microadjusting your focus whenever you lose it, you will train your automatic conentration. This is something I want to continually working on, as I can have a very erratic attention span at times. </p>
<p>These concepts of auto and manual thinking apply to all aspects of emotional intelligence. If you are aware of your actions and thoughts in the workplace, you are more in contral and far less erratic. If you can take a second, or even several minutes, so stop and consider all the external situations internally, you will find that you have a clearer and more decipherable view of every situation and problem. 
I found the two minutes of mindfulness to be similar to meditation. Stopping to experience the sensation of your body, and the straying thoughts of your mind can at first be overwhelming and confusing, but as you become more manually in control of your thoughts, you will find you can clear your mind of the "automatic" messages, like feeling hungry, or bored, or thinking about what you are going to do after work, then you can stop and concentrate on the present task at hand. </p>
