<h2>Process over product</h2>
<p>This concept affected my approach to site building by allowing myself to calm my stresses about whether my site would be able to live up to the incredible sites I hav seen online or from fellow members of my cohort. I was able to take the time to understand what I wanted to do for my site at my own pace. I am thankful for EDA's holistic approach to learning, as the process and personal approach are considered more than just the finished product. In my experience with university, I felt like the learning was very detatched from the student. It was all about one way of teaching, and if that wasn't how you learnt, tough luck. I was also never encouraged to feel like an individual with my own ideas to offer, I just felt like an inferior student to the others who could understand the information and get better "marks" than me.
This put me into a bad habit of stressing whenever something didn't make sense to me immediately, and this ultimately blocked me in my studies. I am still trying to break these habits, but these search inside yourself videos are incredibley inspiring and insightful. They let me feel like myself on my own journey, rather than a student in someone else's.</p>

<p>I have had a lot of respect for meditation in the past. Many of my friends who are artists or muscisians have encouraged me to try it in the past. I have steadily been using meditation as a calming/awareness tool for myself, but I was mostly using it for art or in high stress situations. I am finding myself further encouraged to meditate before coding as it helps clear my head of everything I was doing before I started working, and also of everything I think I would rather be doing. Meditation is an amazing way of calming yourself of distractions and agitations.</p>
<p>From the video below I found great insight into the emotional side of the human experience. Being able to be mindful of your own emotions, and understand that your emotions aren't you, they are a part of your body just as pain or hunger are. Through this thinking, if I feel I am blocked, or am angry, frustrated or sad about anything (work related or otherwise), I know I can meditate and find awareness that those emotions aren't me, and that they will pass shortly with mindfulness. </p>
<p>None of the meditation techniques stood out to me, except I know to focus on having good back posture when I do meditate. My years of computer life have given me bad posture habits, to if I can start to correct that through mindful meditation, maybe eventually I can train myself to have better posture. And body language is everything. If I have better posture and stand taller, that should translate into more self confidence, both in my own perception, but how others will see me too.</p>
