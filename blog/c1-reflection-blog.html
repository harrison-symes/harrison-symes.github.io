    <h1>Reflection of the fireside chat</h1>
    <h2>After watching the hour long fireside chat for EDA, this is my reflection</h2>
    
    <p>
      EDA offers a learning experience that on many levels seems to cater more to many styles of learning, with a focus on learning and the journey rather than the results of each assignment. This experience so far definitely appeals to me far more than my university years. As little as I have done so far, I feel I have been able to do it at my own pace and I have learnt far more. Two years at university and command line was still confusing to me, but one week of doing it at my own speed and I already understand it so much more.

    <p>
      After watching the fireside chat, I am aware that for my personal journey with EDA, I need to ensure that I motivate myself. Previously I have had issues with procrasination and stress. I need to not let things wait until the last minute, and motivate myself to learn for myself. I understand that I am not "entitled" to the knowledge or the qualification that I expect at the end of EDA, but I must push myself as a student and a creator to achieve the goals I have set for myself.

      The 9 weeks remote have eased my mind a lot. I had a fear that the whole 18 weeks would be very full on and learning intensive. I was afraid I would be dropped in the deep in (like university has felt in the past) and that I wouldnt be able to keep up. The current sprints feel like a nice way of guiding my own research, as though I am still preparing for the boot camp, but just being told what I need to be researching. Overall I think I didn't expect to actually be as comfortable as I am now only 1.5 weeks into the program.
