<h1> Self Confidence </h1>

<h3>Relationship between Mindfulness and Self Awareness</h3>
<p>I find the relationship between the two is that these two functions are about stopping your automatic brain and focussing on your manual brain. Gaining complete control over your thoughts and considerations. This lets you observe and calculate more practically and personally, without your feeling getting in the way. It is far easier to consider an issue or idea in logical isolation from emotions, rather than reactively getting caught in how you feel about the matter. (be it angry, sad, confused, these feelings can all distract from your observation and perspective.) Being mindful is not strictly about self, but about your perspective on things. Stopping to observe and consider your perspective is what Self Awareness is. Example: Mindfulness is considering what work there is to do, Self Awareness is considering why it is important for YOU to do that work, and what it will take to get it done.</p>

<h3>Body Scan</h3>
<p>The body scan technique is a useful way of gaining Self Awareness. Particularly, self awareness of your physical body and the nervous system your brain feels. I found that by focusing on the sensation of breathing, starting with my chest, and then working my focus along my limbs one at a time, was an interesting sensation. I felt more concentrated and understanding on the natural systems of my body, air breathing in and out, blood pumping back and forth, muscles tensing and releasing. This is a useful excersize for getting in touch with your body, which is especially important when working with computers, as you can get very caught up in your virtual mind.</p>

<h3>My Emotions, Not Me</h3>
<p>As I explained in the first section of this blog, as much as emotions are a part of you, they are a natural system of the brain to allow you to fluently swap between automatic and manual thinking. In the same way that if you touch a hot surface, you will reactively pull your hand away from it, being emotionally responsive to something will cause you to pull away, retreat. This isn't to say that emotions are a negative thing, but that they are simply a tool that guides your thinking and understanding. While emotions are the corners of mentality, concsious thought can be completely isolated from emotion and based on logic alone.</p>
