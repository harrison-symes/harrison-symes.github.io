<h1>Technical Blog Sprint 3</h1>  

<h2>Responsiveness</h2> 
<p>A responsive site is a website that condenses and realligns to match the size of any window but still retain the intended structure and layout. This means that when viewing the site on a smaller screen, minimized windows, on a phone/tablet etc, the site can still convey all it's important information and UI elements. This is important to so that the sites design and features are visible and maintained under any viewing size.</p>

<h2>Mobile first design</h2>
<p>mobile resolutions are more set than desktop windows, so the site features can be designed to nicely fit onto the screen size. From there you know what the max and min width and height of each "box" or "column", so when you enlarge it to fit full resolution monitors, the features can expand to fit, but will still be visually balanced at any size. It is far easier to start small and stretch it out, rather than try to condense the larger design to fit a smaller screen and then encounter spacing issues. </p>
<p> framework is the base layout of the website before it is made. They are important because you need to plan the spacing and allignment of the website, as it is more structurally pleasing if the space that each element occupies is considered before starting to code the website. The con of frameworks is that maybe your design doesn't look as nice as you expected, or you change your mind on the position/size of elements as you work on it. This con is offset however, by the fact that you would encounter more of these problems if you didnt have a framework. Wireframes fall under framework, but help to allign the elements to a 12x12 grid (at least in the personal situations that I have used wireframes so far). Web design is generally easier when you break elements down into squares (boxifying).</p>
