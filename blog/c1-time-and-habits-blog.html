    <h1>Time and Habits</h1>
    <h2>After watching the hour long fireside chat for EDA, this is my reflection</h2>
    
    <p>
      I have started using the pomodoro technique and am finding it very successful so far. I read about it on fellow student Lisa Seeto's blog, and it was also mentioned in the fireside chat and in the time and habit management resource page.

      This technique works well for me, as I have bad procrastination and distraction habits, and can get exausted from focusing on one task for hours at a time. Trying to push through for too long always results in me getting blocked. With the pomodoro technique, I am adjusting to spending 25 minutes at a time on a task, but the main thing I need to focus on is limiting the break time to 5 minutes. Once I stop I can feel hesitant to start again, so I need to continue to time and push myself. Toggl is a great tool for this, and time management in general.

      I use meditation sometimes, mainly at times when I am creatively blocked. I usually use this when it comes to things like writing or painting, so I need to understand how it can help to relax my logical brain as well as my creative brain. I have some subconscious bias that makes me think that if I meditate before coding it won't improve my results, but I need to learn how it can relax my mind generally so that I can use it to focus and absorb information more easily.
