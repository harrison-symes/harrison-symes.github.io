<h3>Programming Triggers</h3>
<p>While I dislike use of the term "trigger" for something that displeases you, my biggest block when programming is when a small element of a program doesn't work as I expect it to, and I can't find any observable reason why. Staring at one bug without being able to solve it for an extended period of time can be incredibly frustrating for me.</p>
<h3>Siberian North Railroad Excersize</h3>
<p>This excersize is effectively the steps I take to calm down and refocus. Stopping, Breathing, Noticing, Reflecting, Responding. Usually when I get blocked, I will stand up, or leave the room for a few minutes to clear my head. This way once I sit back down again I can more calming look at things from fresh eyes, without skimming over elements that I am confident are correct. Then I can slowly read the code, usually explaining it out loud to myself so I can notice if there are segments that are written incorrectly, have faulty logic, or maybe something that I don't understand as well as I should. Usually by working through the problem this way I am able to solve the issue, which often is a small syntax error, or a logic negation I didn't catch when I was frustrated.</p>
