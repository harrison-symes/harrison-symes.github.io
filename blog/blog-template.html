          <h3 class="seperator">Time and Habits</h3>
          <h4>After watching the hour long fireside chat for EDA, this is my reflection</h4>
          <p>I have started using the pomodoro technique and am finding it very successful so far. I read about it on fellow student Lisa Seeto's blog, and it was also mentioned in the fireside chat and in the time and habit management resource page. 
          </p>
          <p>This technique works well for me, as I have bad procrastination and distraction habits, and can get exausted from focusing on one task for hours at a time. Trying to push through for too long always results in me getting blocked. With the pomodoro technique, I am adjusting to spending 25 minutes at a time on a task, but the main thing I need to focus on is limiting the break time to 5 minutes. Once I stop I can feel hesitant to start again, so I need to continue to time and push myself. Toggl is a great tool for this, and time management in general. 
          </p>
          <p>I use meditation sometimes, mainly at times when I am creatively blocked. I usually use this when it comes to things like writing or painting, so I need to understand how it can help to relax my logical brain as well as my creative brain. I have some subconscious bias that makes me think that if I meditate before coding it won't improve my results, but I need to learn how it can relax my mind generally so that I can use it to focus and absorb information more easily.

          <h3 class="seperator">Emotional Intelligence</h3>
          <h1>Chapter 1 of Search Inside Yourself</h1>
          <h2>What did I learn?</h2>
          <p>While it is hard to pinpoint exactly what I learnt, there are certain points that resonated with me. The first speaker in the 101 video talked about how his "job title" stemmed from his general merriness, and his passion for making other people laugh. In the workplace I am the same, I take on a character who aims to entertaining my colleauges and work friends. I understand that work can be repertitive and tiresome, and so in the hospitality industry, sometimes a good laugh now and then can help seperate the monotony of quiet hours, and the stress or a rush hour. I can assume the same goes for the web development industry. Sometimes the work load can feel heavy, but while you are surrounded by people who are sociable and entertaining to you, the stress can be negated. 
          Emotional Intelligence helps people to maintain a positive attitude in the workplace, both with their own work, and how they work and interact with others. Stopping to be mindful of the work other people are doing and the expectations of yourself both as a worker and a peer can help you to act rationally with awareness. This is a positive skill in the work industry, as irrational, erratic and inconsiderate workers and undesireable, no matter how skilled they are, when it comes to working in a team. </p>
          <h2>Mindfullness</h2>
          <p>Before starting at dev I have had a growing interest in the mind. When it comes to concepts such as ego and awareness, so the concepts of mindfulness fall under this interest to me. The mind can operate in automatic or manual mode, and one of the best examples of this to me is breathing. When you think about your breathing, you are manually breathing. Eventually you will forget about your breathing and you will start breathing automatically. The same can go for concentration, as stated in this chapter. When you lose concentration, you can gain it again as soon as you realise that you lost it. So similar to breathing, there is analogously manual and automatic concentration. The expectation of training yourself to concentrate, it that if you keep microadjusting your focus whenever you lose it, you will train your automatic conentration. This is something I want to continually working on, as I can have a very erratic attention span at times. </p>
          <p>These concepts of auto and manual thinking apply to all aspects of emotional intelligence. If you are aware of your actions and thoughts in the workplace, you are more in contral and far less erratic. If you can take a second, or even several minutes, so stop and consider all the external situations internally, you will find that you have a clearer and more decipherable view of every situation and problem. 
          I found the two minutes of mindfulness to be similar to meditation. Stopping to experience the sensation of your body, and the straying thoughts of your mind can at first be overwhelming and confusing, but as you become more manually in control of your thoughts, you will find you can clear your mind of the "automatic" messages, like feeling hungry, or bored, or thinking about what you are going to do after work, then you can stop and concentrate on the present task at hand. </p>

          <h3 class="seperator">Meditation Process</h3>
          <h1>Chapter 2 of Search Inside Yourself</h1>
          <h2>Process over product</h2>
          <p>This concept affected my approach to site building by allowing myself to calm my stresses about whether my site would be able to live up to the incredible sites I hav seen online or from fellow members of my cohort. I was able to take the time to understand what I wanted to do for my site at my own pace. I am thankful for EDA's holistic approach to learning, as the process and personal approach are considered more than just the finished product. In my experience with university, I felt like the learning was very detatched from the student. It was all about one way of teaching, and if that wasn't how you learnt, tough luck. I was also never encouraged to feel like an individual with my own ideas to offer, I just felt like an inferior student to the others who could understand the information and get better "marks" than me.
          This put me into a bad habit of stressing whenever something didn't make sense to me immediately, and this ultimately blocked me in my studies. I am still trying to break these habits, but these search inside yourself videos are incredibley inspiring and insightful. They let me feel like myself on my own journey, rather than a student in someone else's.</p>
          <p>I have had a lot of respect for meditation in the past. Many of my friends who are artists or muscisians have encouraged me to try it in the past. I have steadily been using meditation as a calming/awareness tool for myself, but I was mostly using it for art or in high stress situations. I am finding myself further encouraged to meditate before coding as it helps clear my head of everything I was doing before I started working, and also of everything I think I would rather be doing. Meditation is an amazing way of calming yourself of distractions and agitations.</p>
          <p>From the video below I found great insight into the emotional side of the human experience. Being able to be mindful of your own emotions, and understand that your emotions aren't you, they are a part of your body just as pain or hunger are. Through this thinking, if I feel I am blocked, or am angry, frustrated or sad about anything (work related or otherwise), I know I can meditate and find awareness that those emotions aren't me, and that they will pass shortly with mindfulness. </p>
          <p>None of the meditation techniques stood out to me, except I know to focus on having good back posture when I do meditate. My years of computer life have given me bad posture habits, to if I can start to correct that through mindful meditation, maybe eventually I can train myself to have better posture. And body language is everything. If I have better posture and stand taller, that should translate into more self confidence, both in my own perception, but how others will see me too.</p>

          <h1>Chapter 3 of Search Inside Yourself</h1>
          <h2>Mindfulness Conversation</h2>
          <p>The midnfulness conversation involved on person talking in monologue for 4 minutes, and then having the second person attempt to explain/repeat what they had said. You continue correcting the other person until you are certain that they fully understand what you intended initially. This was a very interesting excersize, and I tried it with my younger brother. I find that the problem with words is that they feel very 100% in their definitiona and interpretation, but ideas are never really that clear. One persons understanding of a sentence or idea may vary to another persons, due to their own personal experience and emotional connection the the words and ideas expressed. So in my conversation with my brother, there was obviously already a lot of pretense about what we knew and thought about each other, which I believe could skew the results of a conversation like this. Any idea I would express, he would subconsciously associate it to things I have expressed before, so some ideas took certain clarifying. When it was his turn to talk, I paid mindfullness to the "dipping" technique, of giving the other person your full attention, but still maintaining focus of your body and mind. I was paying attention to everything he said, and was trying to process it in isolation of what he was saying now, rather than on top of what he has said in the past. I found the experience of conversation this way to be far different, as being more midnful of the language used to express ideas helped me to see the expression in it's "true" form, seperate from my own emotional connection to the speaker or the words used.</p>

          <p>I will continue to use the dipping technique, as I find having focus on yourself while you are the listener is a great way to continue to pay attention, you don't shift into auto listening mode as you are being mindful of yourself and what you are listening to. I am constantly trying to put myself into my manual mind, as my automatic mind is prone to distraction and addiction, but my manual mind is logical and doesnt desire such things.</p>

          <h1>Chapter 4 of Search Inside Yourself</h1>
          <h3>Relationship between Mindfulness and Self Awareness</h3>
          <p>I find the relationship between the two is that these two functions are about stopping your automatic brain and focussing on your manual brain. Gaining complete control over your thoughts and considerations. This lets you observe and calculate more practically and personally, without your feeling getting in the way. It is far easier to consider an issue or idea in logical isolation from emotions, rather than reactively getting caught in how you feel about the matter. (be it angry, sad, confused, these feelings can all distract from your observation and perspective.) Being mindful is not strictly about self, but about your perspective on things. Stopping to observe and consider your perspective is what Self Awareness is. Example: Mindfulness is considering what work there is to do, Self Awareness is considering why it is important for YOU to do that work, and what it will take to get it done.</p>

          <h3>Body Scan</h3>
          <p>The body scan technique is a useful way of gaining Self Awareness. Particularly, self awareness of your physical body and the nervous system your brain feels. I found that by focusing on the sensation of breathing, starting with my chest, and then working my focus along my limbs one at a time, was an interesting sensation. I felt more concentrated and understanding on the natural systems of my body, air breathing in and out, blood pumping back and forth, muscles tensing and releasing. This is a useful excersize for getting in touch with your body, which is especially important when working with computers, as you can get very caught up in your virtual mind.</p>

          <h3>My Emotions, Not Me</h3>
          <p>As I explained in the first section of this blog, as much as emotions are a part of you, they are a natural system of the brain to allow you to fluently swap between automatic and manual thinking. In the same way that if you touch a hot surface, you will reactively pull your hand away from it, being emotionally responsive to something will cause you to pull away, retreat. This isn't to say that emotions are a negative thing, but that they are simply a tool that guides your thinking and understanding. While emotions are the corners of mentality, concsious thought can be completely isolated from emotion and based on logic alone.</p>

          <p>While I dislike use of the term "trigger" for something that displeases you, my biggest block when programming is when a small element of a program doesn't work as I expect it to, and I can't find any observable reason why. Staring at one bug without being able to solve it for an extended period of time can be incredibly frustrating for me.</p>
          <h3>Siberian North Railroad Excersize</h3>
          <p>This excersize is effectively the steps I take to calm down and refocus. Stopping, Breathing, Noticing, Reflecting, Responding. Usually when I get blocked, I will stand up, or leave the room for a few minutes to clear my head. This way once I sit back down again I can more calming look at things from fresh eyes, without skimming over elements that I am confident are correct. Then I can slowly read the code, usually explaining it out loud to myself so I can notice if there are segments that are written incorrectly, have faulty logic, or maybe something that I don't understand as well as I should. Usually by working through the problem this way I am able to solve the issue, which often is a small syntax error, or a logic negation I didn't catch when I was frustrated.</p>
