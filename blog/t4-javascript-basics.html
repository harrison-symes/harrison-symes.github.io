  <h1>Code Academy - Javascript Basics</h1>

  <h2>How does Javascript compare to Html and Css?</h2>
  <p>Javacript is a language that qwork sequentially (like java, or other object oriented languages like python and c. Javascript can be used alongside html and css to change elements, or animate elements. Html lays the foundation and the information. Css decorates and organizes that information, and Javascript allows the position and elements to change on the fly, with updates and actions.</p>

  <h2>Control Flow Loops</h2>
  <p>Javascript works sequentially, in that is carries out the code as it is written from top to bottom.  There are also loop elements, where you can make the code repeat a segement of code until a set condition is complete. In everyday life, this could be like going to school and having 6 classes. Each class is like another sequence of the loop, and the loop continues until the 6 classes have been complete.</p>

  <h2>Arrays and Object Literals</h2>
  <p>Data in arrays is stored in indexs, where the index position is the "key" to access the data, and the data stored is the "value". In Object literals, data is stored in object format, where the key is created based of a variable name that you assign it, so it can be anything from '1' to "Big Piece of Toast". An Array is like a row of boxes, and object literals are like a bag filled with connected items.</p>

  <h2>Functions</h2>
  <p>A function is a precoded segment that takes parameters and generally returns something. Because the function is premade for a purpose, it can be called any time it is needed to translatte the parameters into a return statement. It also means that you don't have to rewrite certain segments of code if you are expecting to call upon that "function" several times. The simplest example is a function that takes 2 numbers and returns the sum of those numbers. A more complex example is a function that takes and array and a string, and returns an array of objects within the first array that contained the string.</p>
