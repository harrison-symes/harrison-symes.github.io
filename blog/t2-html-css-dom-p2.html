  <h2>Grid Based Design</h2>
  <p>Grid based design is a way of breaking down a webpage into the space per amount of rows and columns. An example from the udacity course is of a page that uses 2, 3 or 4 columns at once. Because of this, you would break down the columns into 1/12s of the width of the page, and allign everything according to each 1/12. The same goes for rows if the rows are divided. 
  <h2>Responsive Webpages</h2>
  <p>Responsive pages are important nowadays as people often browse webpages from phones of varying resolutions, tablets, and sometimes computer monitors of different resolutions too. If you only design the webpage for one of these resolutions, the layout may fall apart on the other devices. With responsive design, the page elements are more flexible and will arrange nicely when viewed in different window sizes or resolutions. 
  <h2>Semantic Structure</h2>
  <p>This is the use of diffing headers and subsections. h1 / h2 are examples of this. Semantic structure is the reason that paragraphs, subtitles and the page header of this page stand out from each other.</p>
