<h2>Mindfulness Conversation</h2>
<p>The midnfulness conversation involved on person talking in monologue for 4 minutes, and then having the second person attempt to explain/repeat what they had said. You continue correcting the other person until you are certain that they fully understand what you intended initially. This was a very interesting excersize, and I tried it with my younger brother. I find that the problem with words is that they feel very 100% in their definitiona and interpretation, but ideas are never really that clear. One persons understanding of a sentence or idea may vary to another persons, due to their own personal experience and emotional connection the the words and ideas expressed. So in my conversation with my brother, there was obviously already a lot of pretense about what we knew and thought about each other, which I believe could skew the results of a conversation like this. Any idea I would express, he would subconsciously associate it to things I have expressed before, so some ideas took certain clarifying. When it was his turn to talk, I paid mindfullness to the "dipping" technique, of giving the other person your full attention, but still maintaining focus of your body and mind. I was paying attention to everything he said, and was trying to process it in isolation of what he was saying now, rather than on top of what he has said in the past. I found the experience of conversation this way to be far different, as being more midnful of the language used to express ideas helped me to see the expression in it's "true" form, seperate from my own emotional connection to the speaker or the words used.</p>

<p>I will continue to use the dipping technique, as I find having focus on yourself while you are the listener is a great way to continue to pay attention, you don't shift into auto listening mode as you are being mindful of yourself and what you are listening to. I am constantly trying to put myself into my manual mind, as my automatic mind is prone to distraction and addiction, but my manual mind is logical and doesnt desire such things.</p>
