      I work at a cinema, so I get to watch all the movies I want to see, which is nice. But it also means I have to watch the hollywood treadmill of terrible movies as they roll through. There are some gems however. Example? Nah. All subjective.

      I have a rat named Icarus, he is a crazy little man, but I love him. I also have two dogs, one of which is resigned to providing me warmth and cuddles every night. He is fluffy and his name is Cino.
